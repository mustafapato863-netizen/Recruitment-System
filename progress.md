### Delegation queue (agy implement + opencode/muse-spark-1.3 review + orchestrator commit, one commit per task)
| Task | Implementer | Review | Commit |
|------|-------------|--------|--------|
| P0.1 | pre-existing tree | opencode muse-spark-1.3 read-only PASS | 14df39e |
| P0.2 | agy (report lost on abort; work recovered) | opencode muse-spark-1.3 read-only PASS | 13d504c |
| P0.3 | agy | opencode muse-spark-1.3 read-only PASS; tsc clean; web build ok | pending |
| P0.2–P4.3 | agy (sequential) | opencode muse-spark-1.3 read-only | per task |

### Delegation mandates (user-approved 2026-09-04)
- agy runs use --dangerously-skip-permissions (headless write auto-denied without it). Treat agy runs as full access; orchestrator diff review is the safety net.
- Fixed PreToolUse hook quoting bug in ~/.gemini/config/plugins/googlecloudtools.datacloud_telemetry/hooks.json.

- [x] Task P0.2: Remove hardcoded fallback data from ApplicationDetailPage.tsx
  - Replaced hardcoded strings ('Ali Hassan', 'Frontend Developer', 'ali.hassan@email.com', '+20 101 234 5678', 'Cairo, Egypt', 'APP-02481', tags mock array) with null-safe accessors or dynamic empty states.
  - Added PageState empty banner when candidate is missing and hidden rows when email/phone/location are null.
  - Added real timeline rendering from history API and empty state for notes.
  - tsc clean (0 errors); web tests 58/58 pass.
  - Orchestrator verification 2026-09-04: opencode review (muse-spark-1.3, read-only) PASS items 1-4, P0.1 untouched, no new deps; tsc re-run clean; web tests re-run 58/58 pass. Committed.

- [x] Task P0.3: Green build gate + export SLAIndicator
  - Exported SLAIndicator from apps/web/src/components/ui/index.ts.
  - Verified `pnpm --dir apps/web exec tsc -p tsconfig.app.json --noEmit` passes with 0 errors.
  - Verified `pnpm --dir apps/web build` passes with 0 errors (production build succeeded).
  - Verified no TypeScript errors in ApplicationDetailPage.tsx or any P0.1/P0.2 touched files.
